            <p> I've never really put my all into a project like I did for this one. At first, I didn't consider myself much of a UI kind of guy, but I wanted to challenge myself for this project by thinking in terms of design and the user experience. I made this project with my friend, Karl, for my Software Methodology class and I'm super proud of the outcome. Technologies used include <b>JavaFX</b> and <b>Scene Builder</b>.</p>

            <p>The first step in this project was figuring out the UI components for it. Sketching out my idea for how the app would look and feel, I knew I wanted there to be thumbnails displayed in a grid fashion with a sense of minimalism. After researching online, I figured out how to manifest the grid format by using JavaFX containers and widgets. I designed all of the different pages using Scene Builder, and when it was ready, I uploaded all of them to my eclipse workspace to get cracking on the back-end.</p>
            <p> Now, I needed to figure out how to breathe life into all of the UI using java. Splitting the work up with my partner, we decided I would handle the grid components and he would handle the tagging and searching aspects. I found a clever way to dynamically add albums and photos to the gridpane without having to refresh. My next challenge was figuring out how I could get the user to interact with photos differently if they wanted to say, open, copy, delete, or move them. For this, I put code in to recognize left clicks as wanting to open the photo, and right clicks as wanting to edit them. Upon right clicking a photo, the photo is higlighted and a bunch of accessory buttons are enabled that allows the user to delete, copy, or move them. The rest of the project was a breeze.
