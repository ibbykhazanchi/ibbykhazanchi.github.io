            <p>This project allows you to automatically send birthday messages to your Facebook friends on their birthdays, given that you have them in your contacts. Technologies used include <b>Selenium </b>to webscrape, the <b>Google People API</b> to fetch your contact data, as well as <b>SMTPLIB</b> to programatically send texts. View the source code here!                    <a class="social-list__link" href="https://github.com/ibbykhazanchi/fb-birthday-bot">

            <p>A mentor of mine told me that the best way to learn python is by trying to automate some part of your life. Therefore, I wanted to make an automation that would help streamline some part of my life, even if in a frivolous way. I noticed that everyday when I wake up, I get notifications from facebook notifying me which one of my friend's have birthdays today. Rather than having to individually text message each of my friends, I figured it would be fun to have python do it for me! </p>
            <p>Some of the challenges I ran into was first figuring out how to scrape the data from facebook. There were a lot of glitches at first, so I had to make sure I was grabbing the right HTML element by extensive trial and error. Also, SMTPLIB has a quirk in that it needs to know what carrier a cell phone number has in order to send a message to them. Obviously, you woudn't know a carrier just by looking at the number. I cirumvented this issue by sending texts to all four major carriers (ATT, Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile), and filtering the "message not sent" emails in my inbox.</p>
